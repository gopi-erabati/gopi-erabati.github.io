I hold a 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲-𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗲 𝗣𝗵𝗗 from the [University of Coimbra, Portugal](https://www.uc.pt/), where I specialized in **𝗦𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗲 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴**—pushing the boundaries of AI-driven perception! 🚘🤖

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Helder Araujo](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9544-424X).
My primary research interests are focused on computer vision and machine learning, specifically tasks related to scene understanding. 

During my Ph.D. thesis, I worked on fundamental scene understanding tasks such as 3D object detection using LiDAR and
multi-modal data fusion, 3D semantic segmentation, and panoptic driving perception.

Prior to joining UC, I obtained a M.Sc. degree in Computer Vision in the [Erasmus VIBOT (VIsion and RoBOTics)](https://www.vibot.org/) 
program at the [Université de Dijon, France](https://en.u-bourgogne.fr/).
I had done my master thesis advised by [Prof. Frédéric Lerasle](https://homepages.laas.fr/lerasle/) 
and my summer internship advised by [Dr. Simon Lacroix](https://homepages.laas.fr/simon/HomePage/Home.html) at [LAAS-CNRS, France](https://www.laas.fr/en/).
I had obtained a B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at [Kakatiya University, India](https://kitsw.ac.in/).
I received a _Gold Medal from the Hon'ble Governor of Telangana, India, for excellence in academics_ during my 
bachleor's degree at Kakatiya University, India.
